# Motion Detector

  This motion detector records a live video from a camera and generates a csv file and a graph which shows 
  whenever an object was moving in the frame.
  
## What I Learned 

  - Working with dataframes (pandas)
  - Plotting graphs from a data
  - Working with live video (cv2)

### Instructions

  - Run log_n_plot.py (The script will 'catch' the first frame so in order for it to work as purposed run the script while the background       is static)
  - Quit by pressing 'q'
